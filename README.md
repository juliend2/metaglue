## TODO

* modify Mermaid so that:
  * youtube links are replaced by the video's thumbnail (using youtube API)
  * google map links are replaced by an embedded map image
  * remote images can be placed as nodes
  * we can set the proper icon for the nodes that point to a file according to
    its extension.
  * we can have text blobs (scrollable, to save some space)
  * we can have the node background image set to the favicon, if one is found
