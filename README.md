## TODO

* modify Mermaid so that:
  * inline text blob nodes (scrollable, to save some space)
  * nodes pointing to dropbox files
  * nodes pointing to local files
  * remote images can be placed as nodes
    * we can set the proper icon for the nodes that point to a file according to
      its extension.
  * other Web links should be linkable and displayed with icons that shows
    it's a Web link
* make the UI a little more compact (maybe drop materialize)
