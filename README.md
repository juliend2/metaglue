## TODO

* modify Mermaid so that:
  * remote images can be placed as nodes
    * we can set the proper icon for the nodes that point to a file according to
      its extension.
* support offline mode (it should fallback to a simple youtube icon instead of
  the thumbnail we get from the API, if we don't have network when loading the
  page if the app is served locally).
